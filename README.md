# WARNING
This program is stable, but navigating through the codebase will be like solving a newspaper maze puzzle with eyes closed shut. In the name of efficiency and due to the limited timeframe, no VENVs were used. Neither has the code been structured into files. Even the frontend HTML sits on one file, which was the easiest way I could upload it to Google Drive yesterday. 

# Prerequisities
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will downlaod all external modules required for the program to run without error. GhostScript, ImageMagick, and Tesseract must also be installed as executables. Once downloaded, the server can be spun up with - 
```
cd path/to/folder && python main.py
```
